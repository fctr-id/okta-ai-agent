# Initial Concept

Automated analysis of existing project: Tako AI Agent for Okta.

# Product Definition: Tako AI Agent for Okta

## Vision & Purpose
Tako AI is the world's first Autonomous AI Engineer for Okta. It is designed to transform identity management from a series of manual, complex tasks into a seamless, natural language experience. The ultimate goal is for Tako to serve as a **fully functional Okta Administrator**, capable of autonomously managing the entire identity lifecycle and security posture.

## Target Audience
- **IT Administrators & Help Desk:** To automate routine tasks and streamline user support.
- **Security Analysts & Auditors:** For rapid investigation, auditing, and threat remediation.
- **Developers & Architects:** To integrate identity operations into broader automated workflows.

## Primary Goals
- **Autonomous Administration:** Move beyond simple querying to full lifecycle management and proactive security enforcement.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Use natural language to eliminate the need for manual API exploration or complex report building.
- **Cost Reduction:** Employ a multi-agent architecture to reduce AI token consumption and minimize manual engineering effort.
- **Deterministic Accuracy:** Ensure production-ready results through a specialized committee of agents (Router, SQL, API, Synthesis).

## Key Features & Capabilities
- **Natural Language Command Center:** Ask questions and give instructions in plain English to manage users, groups, apps, and policies.
- **Self-Healing Multi-Agent Architecture:** Specialized agents collaborate to generate, validate, and auto-correct code for deterministic data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Hybrid Data Access:** Optimized retrieval using a combination of real-time Okta API calls and high-performance local SQLite synchronization.
- **Lifecycle Automation:** (Future Focus) Automated onboarding, offboarding, and attribute management.
- **Proactive Security:** (Future Focus) AI-driven detection and remediation of security anomalies.
