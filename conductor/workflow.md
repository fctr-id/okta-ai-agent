# Project Workflow

## Development Cycle
- **Task-Based Execution:** Break all features into small, testable tasks.
- **Commit Frequency:** Commit changes after every completed task.
- **Documentation:** Use Git Notes to record a summary of each task's impact.

## Standards
- **Test Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for new logic.
- **Phase Completion Protocol:** Every phase in a track's plan must end with a manual verification task.

## Checkpointing Protocol (Meta-Task)
- For each Phase completion, perform:
  1. **Verification:** Ensure all tasks in the phase are functional.
  2. **Review:** Cross-check against the track's specification.
  3. **Checkpoint:** Commit all changes with a descriptive message.
