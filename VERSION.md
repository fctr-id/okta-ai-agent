# Version History

## Current latest: v2.0.0-beta - "The Committee Returns"

**🚨 BREAKING CHANGES - Database Migration Required:**
- **CRITICAL**: If upgrading from v1.x, you MUST delete your existing `sqlite_db/okta_sync.db` and perform a full resync
- **Why**: Complete architecture rewrite + fundamental schema changes to app assignments
- **Action**: Delete database → Restart → Run full sync

**2. Multi-Agent Committee Architecture:**
- **Specialized Agents**: Router, SQL Discovery, API Discovery, and Synthesis agents working in concert
- **50-70% Cost Reduction**: Isolated contexts prevent token bloat, significantly reducing API costs
- **Artifact-Based Communication**: Agents pass validated JSON artifacts, eliminating context pollution
- **Bidirectional Handoff**: SQL ↔ API agents dynamically request data from each other (up to 6 phases per query)
- **Granular Progress**: Real-time visibility into each agent's execution

**Performance Improvements:**
- **10x Faster Sync Operations**: Reduced RATE_LIMIT_DELAY from 100ms to 10ms plus parallel relationship fetching
- **Human-Readable Duration Logging**: "2m 15s" instead of "135.42s"
- **Optimized Sync Order**: Groups → Users → Apps (fixed FK constraint issues)

**AI Provider Enhancements:**
- **Google AI Studio Support**: Added simple API key-based access to Google Gemini models via the new `google` provider option
- **Modern Google Integration**: Updated to use `GoogleModel` and `GoogleProvider` from pydantic-ai
- **Vertex AI Improvements**: Enhanced enterprise Vertex AI configuration

**Database Schema Changes:**
- **user_application_assignments**: Added `assignment_type` (DIRECT/GROUP), `group_name`, `group_okta_id`, `assignment_status`; Removed `app_instance_id`
- **New index**: `idx_uaa_assignment_type` for efficient filtering
- **Sync strategy**: Changed to DELETE-INSERT (replaced UPSERT)

**Documentation & Query Enhancements:**
- Updated SQL discovery prompts with new schema patterns
- Added 5 new SQL query patterns (simple + complex)
- Case-insensitive searches by default for entity names
- Updated shared_schema.py with complete field documentation

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed database path detection (now finds `okta_sync.db` correctly)
- Fixed router setup redirect (prevents access to setup after completion)
- Removed legacy `okta_data.db` references

## v1.5.0-beta - "The React Revolution"

**Major Architecture Shift:**
- **Single ReAct Agent**: Collapsed the multi-agent committee into a single, autonomous ReAct (Reason & Act) engineer.
- **Self-Healing Code**: The agent now writes, executes, and fixes its own code in a sandboxed environment.
- **Hybrid Execution**: Seamlessly switches between SQLite and API calls within the same reasoning loop.

**New Features:**
- **Live "Thinking" UI**: Real-time visibility into the agent's thought process, code generation, and execution steps.
- **Direct Script Display**: View the actual Python code generated by the agent in the UI.
